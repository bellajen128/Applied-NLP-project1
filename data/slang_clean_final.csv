8848122,friendly fade,"A [passive-aggressive] method to 'break up' with a friend without being hurtful. Similar to ghosting, this method is NOT an abrupt process and can apply to just about anyone.

For ex: take a week to return a voicemail or a few days for a text. As the weeks go by, the lag between all [communications] gradually increases.  • Never answer the phone if you see that person's number on your caller ID. Wait at least a week to return the message (unless it's an emergency), preferably via text.  • Avoid face-to-face meetings (like coffee or lunch) and make excuses to skip activities you both enjoyed previously (like [going to the movies]).  The goal is to gently un-friend that person at a kind and gingerly pace. It can be a very effective method for those averse to conflict or part of tightly knit groups. Over time, your feelings may change, and you may want to rekindle the friendship. With this method, you haven't burned all your bridges.","After years of being told by her [best friend] that she needed to lose weight, Lizzie decided to do the friendly fade.

11888707,DMG,"AKA [Dank Memes Gang]. They think they're 4chan levels of dank, but it's a [facebook group].  Some background: the Dank memes gang is, as previously mentioned, a [facebook group] for posting memes. Oddly enough they consider themselves to be dank, but as someone who has been on the group since early this year their comedy has gone from little to none.  Perhaps it used to be funny but it's basically just edgy jokes with no substance. While edgy jokes can be used well, repeating the same bloody 'black people are slaves' joke or the 'muslims are terrorists' joke gets old. Once again, this format and these jokes in particular can be funny, but they just aren't when repeated so much. I've seen picnic blankets with less predictable patterns.  And the videos that get posted there? Not funny. Only a few are, and they're all stolen from ya boy dolan dark. The rest are either just mocking someone's appearance in a really unfunny way or overusing bass boost.  Overall, what I can say about the dank memes gang is this: they take good ideas and run them into the ground. They're beating dead horses left right and centre. Nobody cares about your 32767th holocaust meme. Stop it.  Do you want good memes? Go find them on 4chan. If you're not inclined to sift through all the garbage, you can try reddit.

To achieve a #yogafie, at the #Sarvangasana or #shoulderstand #āsana ,the person uses their flexibility to hold their phone using one of their feet and then presses the screen with the other foot (preferably the dominant one). Alternatively, if your phone camera does not support touch screen capture, you could use the timer to start the yogafie, but your phone has to be between your feet at the Sarvangasana peak when you take the picture. That’s the challenge!  Try practicing the pose first, and only attempt this after stretching. The aim is to combine yoga with selfie taking in an enjoyable challenge and not to get anyone injured ;).

The Recording Industry [Association] of America (RIAA) unsuccessfully lobbied against the [introduction] of DAT devices into the US, but a tax was imposed on DAT recorders and blank media from 1992. At the time, it was one of the highest quality audio formats, comparable to Compact Disc.  It was never widely adopted by consumers due to its cost, but saw use in [professional] recording and as a data storage medium (called Digital Data Storage or DDS).  A small number of albums were commercially released on DAT in the first few years of the format.  In 2005, Sony discontinued its remaining DAT recorders.","Wow, DAT [sounds] like I'm [really] there [in the studio]",2017-03-22T00:00:00Z

The two laws were passed, ostensibly, to interdict the occurrence of nonconsensual sex [trafficking]; in other words to combat sex slavery--often of minors. SW's--most of whom do not consider themselves needing rescue; and their activity they consider to be adult and mutually consensual--feel affected as [innocent bystanders]. (Oh, yes; SW's also consider themselves innocent). For SW's these laws have greatly degraded their ability to meet clients and vet clients for safety without encountering the ever present scrutiny of law enforcement. SW's have needed to re--occupy unsafe spaces; street solicitation has increased. The shuttering of such sites as Craigslist singles ads by FOSTA has affected SW's world-wide.

17547365,shegaloh,Shegaloh. Is a transgender or crossdresser who is a prostitute. A term used to describe [flamboyant] [transgenders] who frequent karaoke bar scenes and are actually quite talented as a performer in that respect but is prone to being a diva type with unreasonable [expectations] and a false sense of entitlement due to having a good singing voice. Believed to have been used first by young children making fun of a singing trans prostitute. Instead of an opera singer singing ‘Vee garo veegaro! “ it would be ‘shee golo shee golo” derives from the words gigolo and she. Which once was an oxymoron like jumbo shrimp but is now normalized. The “h” at end is used as a added surprise added to word like “ oh ..i didnt know she was a he”  Submitted by LuvH8Luv,"When I saw Kenny backstage with that shegaloh during the karaoke event , it confirmed to me not only does he like hairy woman but he also likes shims who were once hairy but shaved smooth. Thats [the last time] I agree to a 3some with his girlfriend. Now that its known he plays with shegalohs. Maybe that shegaloh will share some shaving techniques cause Kenny’s girlfriend was hairy like a wolf! Uh oh… was she a trans too? What have I possibly done? What a world we live in when one can’t even be sure of what sex a person is anymore. Little did I know, my therapist i was talking to about all this was in fact that same shegaloh at the bar with Kenny. And was a crossdresser on weekends and married with wife and kids. Ironic it is since my therapist is the one who needs therapy. And its situations like this that make [normal people] feel like they need to seek therapy.

This slang is the most common usage of this word today, even becoming a genre of music called Funk. Though, around that time, many [white people] also used the term as a derogatory slang towards blacks by giving it the meaning of ""the nasty body odor of a black person."" This slang definition fell out of use. Around the 1960s this word gained the meaning of ""fine, stylish, or excellent,"" and could (and still can) be used for anything you like.","[Adjective] ¹ ""This cheese is proper funky. [I'll take] three."" ² ""This house smells kinda funky... it's gross."" First Slang ""That jazz solo was straight funky, my guy.

17231072,nft,[glorified] [images] sold for millions of [dollars],"Well, believe me, it's crystal clear: NFT's are racist.  You don't believe this, huh? Well, I'm going to explain. First off, the name. The The Bored Ape Yacht Club wants you to believe that ""NFT"" stands for Non-fungible token. This name might be an accurate name for the images of apes that are sold, but it also stands for ""n****rs for trade"". This is [absolutely not] okay.  NFT's have been fully covered on national news and they usual tell you that images of apes are being traded. What they don't tell you, is that those apes usually have big lips, golden chains and rings and contains an awful lot of stereotypes. NFT's use apes as a methaphor for the stereotypical black communty.  This can be explained: NFT's were invented on 4chan. 4chan is the breedplace of 99% of evil on the internet. The /pol/ communty, already infamous for it's racism and [anti-semitism]. created NFT's because they want to insult black people. Using complex trading methods on specific websites on the internet and needing a fast connection to the [world wide web] they try to exclude as many black people (mainly the African continent).  It even goes beyond that. Neo-Nazi artists, like Ben Garisson and StoneToss have recently used this way of trading to sell their art full of hate. They can do this because NFT's are completely anonymous.  [Republicans] and right-wingers say they screenshot NFT's. This is not an harmless joke, they try to [demonstrate] how 'worthless' NFT's (abbreviation for: N****rs for Trade) are.",2022-05-13T07:43:51.079Z

I noticed that it seems to be the case that people vary in terms of what governs their behavior in the context of Freudian [Psychology]. How do I frame this properly?.... So... Let's start with the concept of a person's 'Drive'. You have your temperamental proclivities and these proclivities 'drive' your behavior (to whatever extent). In Freudian Psychology you have the Id (Instinct) Ego (Reality) Superego (Morality) and all people have these aspects within them. But to what degree are people 'Driven' by these different aspects of Psychology? Because it clearly varies. And how does it relate to their temperament in the context of the 'Big 5 [personality] traits'? So if you put all 3 on a scale like this  <Id------------Ego----------Superego>  1☝️ 2☝️ What causes someone to end up at point '1' I'm terms of their 'drive' as opposed to point '2'? So conscientious people tend to be [conservative] and [conservatives] tend to be religious. But not all [religious people] are priest. People higher in openness a usually liberal. Liberals seem less likely to be religious. But not all liberals are activist types. It seems as the activists are more heavily driven by Superego than non-activists. You could even say the radical types are more heavily driven by Superego (which is why the Social Justice movement is likened to a sort of faux religion). What is the cause for this and what causes someone to be 'Amoral' or more ID driven (for example hedonistic types)? Is it socialization?""",2022-05-12T12:51:10.382Z

Players assume the role of “agents” within a near-future dystopian world with each having a [unique] set of abilities to compliment the lethal set of 17 different guns available to every player.What is the objective in VALORANT? The game's competitive mode is 5vs5 with one team assuming the attackers and the other the defenders with the first to reach 13 rounds to win the match.  The attacker’s goal is to plant and detonate an item called “the spike” at one of two (or three) sites [on the battlefield], while the defender’s objective is to prevent the spike from detonating, both teams can also win the round if they eliminate the enemy.  Each round is 2:10 minutes in total with 30 seconds dedicated to the preparation period and 1:40 minutes of time for each team to achieve their respective objectives.

Aside from having [exceptional] nightvision, a petralyn's eyes naturally have sclerae that are dark in color, as well as glowing pupils that change shape based on emotions. The pupils are round and full by default, and a petralyn can willingly choose to have their pupils appear this way, but they may display another shape in response to an [individual] petralyn's mood, although shapes have different meanings for each [one]; for example, a triangle may mean fear for one and joy for another. When using magic, their pupils cover the entire eye. The pupils can also flicker out or even disappear entirely, leaving nothing but the dark sclerae visible.  Originating from the now uninhabitable planet Aeriosis, petralyns are, in fact, aliens. Each one has a special connection to the Aether, a force of pure, [concentrated] light energy. This connection manifests itself in the form of a spark, which is their life source, taking the place of a heart and circulating light magic throughout their bodies rather than blood. Sparks are the reason why their pupils, blood, blush, and markings glow, and the color of a petralyn's spark directly affects the color of their magic. It may also affect the color of their blood, blush, and pupils, and sparks can be multicolor, although rainbow sparks are exclusive to polychromatic petralyns.","If you see [glowing] lights in that cave, there's [probably] a petralyn [nearby].",2023-01-17T21:45:49.252Z

A country with advanced weaponry and [intelligence], established in 1948, following the occupation of Palestine, which was done through very cruel and forceful activities, mainly the Nakbah amongst others.  Zionists believe that they are protecting themselves and establishing freedom, but in doing so, they have been causing unfair misery and misfortune to the innocent indigenous people, all while not feeling sorry for them, but actually expressing intense hatred and distaste towards them.  The indigenous people in Palestine are Semites, including Muslims, Christians, Jews. While most Israelis are Caucasians from Europe. DNA tests are prohibited in Israel.  Today, as of July 2024, this movement is still causing tragedy and misery, causing the loss of over 186,000 innocent lives including women and children, done by dropping a great number of highly explosive missiles, exceeding 45,000 bombs within the first 4 months, which weighed over 65,000 tons. [Hiroshima bomb]: 15,000 tons.  The Israelis claim that these bombs are being used to fight the [Palestinian] resistance.

They reject compromise as weakness, truth as subjective, and pluralism as threat. What began as a slogan — [Make America Great Again] — has evolved into an identity, often resistant to nuance and fueled by a mythology of lost greatness and institutional betrayal.  To call someone a Magatist is to suggest they don’t simply vote Republican — they believe, and that belief shapes their view of country, culture, and even truth itself.","The rally was packed with Magatists waving flags and chanting slogans echoing Trump's America First agenda.  Magatists flooded [social media] with claims of [election fraud], echoing Trump’s narrative without evidence.“  After the indictment, the Magatists flooded [social media] claiming it was all a deep-state hoax.”",2025-05-27T18:11:56.353Z
